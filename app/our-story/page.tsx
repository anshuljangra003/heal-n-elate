              Welcome to our narrativeâ€”a journey crafted from personal challenge, resilience, and a collective vision to
              create a sanctuary for energy healing. Co-founded by two individuals from diverse backgrounds, our paths
              converged in the most unforeseen manner, united by our individual struggles and a deep commitment to
              positively impact the lives of others.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              While each of us were going through our own struggles and navigating the complexities of life, we discovered
              the power of healing modalities in response to our respective challenges.
            </p>

            <p>
              Since 2016, our extensive experience in healing has allowed us to create a meaningful impact and foster
              positive changes in the lives of many individuals, for which we are truly humbled.
            </p>
